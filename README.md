# Demo Project Azure Functions: Customer Inquiry Sentiment - Part 3: CI/CD

This small sample project demonstrates how to implement a very basic Azure Function on the local development environment and how to deploy it to the cloud.

This branch extends the samle by an ARM template to be used in a CI/CD pipeline and retracts from creating the database in-code but rather leaves this task to the build pipeline.
